public class DataTypes01 {
    //public: It means it can be used by the entire project. (public library)
    //        There is no any restriction to use it.
    //        public is one of the "access modifier"s

    //We have 4 access modifiers: i) public > ii) protected > iii)default > iv) private

    //default: It means it is open to a group. (Harvard University Library)
    //         If you make something default in Java, then it will be used just inside the package
    //         To make a class "default" in Java, do not type any access modifier.

    //protected: It means it is open to a group and their kids. (Gym is open to employees and their kids)

    //private: it means it is specific for a person. (Driving license)
    //         If you make something private, you can use it just while you are in the class.
    //         When you go outside the class. it is impossible to use it.

    //When you create something in Java, you should name it.
    //How to name a class: i) start with upper cases
    //                     ii) if you have multiple words, every word should start with upper case
    //                     iii) other characters should be in lower case
    //                     iv) you can use digits in naming

    //The part between the "{" "}" is called "Class Body"
}
